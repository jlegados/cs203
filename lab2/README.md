# Lab 2

## Problem 1

Within the `src` folder, define a Java class of your choosing inside a new `.java` file.
This class must contain at least 3 instance variables: two of different, non-`List`, types, and a third of a type that implements `List`, as discussed in lecture.

The class should have a single constructor that accepts values for and initializes the non-`List` instance variables. The constructor should initialize the `List` type variable to an empty list.

## Problem 2

Write 3 public methods for your class with non-void return types: two non-static and one static.
One method must modify (e.g., insert) elements of the `List` instance variable and another method must iterate through the `List` instance variable.
Getters and setters do not count toward this number.

## Problem 3

Write enough unit tests in the provided `ClassTests.java` file to cover all (100%) lines of code within your class's methods.
Use the "Run with Coverages" button in IntelliJ IDEA to ensure all lines of code are covered.

üóíÔ∏è You will need to submit a screenshot of your test coverages.

## Validation

This lab will be graded manually.
You may demonstrate your program to an instructor for validation.
GitHub **will not** display a checkmark.

## Submission

<p style="font-size: 125%; color: red;">üõë<strong>All work that you submit must represent your own individual effort</strong>üõë</p>

Commit your Lab Codebook changes and push it to GitHub.

Upload screenshots of the following to Canvas:
1. Proof of your submission to GitHub.
2. For problem 3, your 100% line test coverage.

To upload multiple screenshots on Canvas, use the "Add Another File" option.
